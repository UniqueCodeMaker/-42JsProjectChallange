          <p>The two most powerful warriors are patience and time.</p>
          <p>Time is money</p>
          <p>Time waits for no one</p>
          <p>Better three hours too soon than a minute too late</p>
          <p>Lost time is never found again</p>
          <p>Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend</p>
          <p>Time is the wisest counselor of all</p>
          <p>The key is in not spending time, but in investing it</p>
          <p>It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important</p>
          <p>Punctuality is the thief of time</p>

   <p>You always pass failure on the way to success</p>
            <p>No one is perfect - that’s why pencils have erasers</p>
            <p>Winning doesn’t always mean being first. Winning means you’re doing better than you’ve
                done before</p>
            <p>You’re braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think</p>
            <p>It always seems impossible until it
                is done</p>
            <p>Once you replace negative thoughts with positive ones, you’ll start having positive results</p>
            <p>Positive thinking will let you do everything better than negative thinking will</p>
            <p>The only time you fail is when you fall down and stay down</p>
            <p>When you are enthusiastic about what you do, you feel this positive energy. It’s very simple</p>
            <p>Positive anything is better than
                negative nothing</p>
